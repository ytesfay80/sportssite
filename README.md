# sportssite
This is the code for a hobby sportsbook/lottery site I created. The php server code was written by me and the html and css code was from a template. The html was slightly edited to my liking and the information I received from the API was used to fill in the html page.

The mytransactions.php file displays transactions that outputted from the database on the server.
