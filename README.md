# sportssite
This is the code for a hobby sportsbook/lottery site I created around 2015. The php server code was completely written by me and the html/css was from a template and the bootstrap theme. Most of the work I completed was focusing on the backend PHP side so the front end styling isn't much there. I created a MYSQL database to store and retrieve account transactions and login information. The page would call an API from PinnacleSports which would return an XML page which would get parsed with PHP and outputted onto the site.
